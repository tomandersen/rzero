\section{It's Simple}
Well - honestly it is! Since in chapter \ref{quantumMechanicsChapter} and the thesis of the work, we posit that everything is built of gravity, we gravity can't be in a superposition. Particles can't either, and we have a Bohmian trajectory like solution....

Take a double slit experiment. You \textit{can}, in theory use gravity to tell which slit the particle went through, and also see a perfect interference pattern.



This results in specific experimental predictions:
