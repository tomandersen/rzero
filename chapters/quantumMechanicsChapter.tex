\section{Madelung 1927}
While quantum mechanics was becoming the buzz in physics, Madelung\cite{E.Madelung1927} tried to break the field open into the direction it should have gone (and yes that is my opinion). 1927:
\begin{quotation}
	It is shown that the Schrödinger equation for one-electron problems can be transformed into the form of hydrodynamical equations.
\end{quotation}

His observation was that one can take the Schrödinger equation and pull it apart into two equations involving real phenomena, without the pesky $i \equiv \sqrt{-1}$ that causes undergrads all that trouble. 

Turns out $i$ is often concered with drag or honey, etc. So hydrodynamics drops right out of quantum mechanics, if you let it.  

We all know the outcome of that, Madelung was footnoted away, and complex algebra in quantum mechanics became so ingrained in the mind of the standard model physicist that now they are saying it's required!\cite{avellaQuantumMechanicsMust2022} No, American Physical Society $i$ is not required.\cite{mckagueSimulatingQuantumSystems2008}. If you want a simpleton explanation (i.e. by me) you can have a look at the American Physical Society paper and see if the hydrodynamic formulation is mentioned. It's not. The American Physical Society paper does have this 'get out of jail free' scentence in it, though: 

\begin{quotation}
	As Renou and his co-workers point out, these results would not be applicable to alternative formulations of quantum mechanics, such as Bohmian mechanics, which are based on different postulates. Therefore, these results could stimulate attempts to go beyond the standard formalism of quantum mechanics, which, despite great successes in predicting experimental results, is often considered inadequate from an interpretative point of view
\end{quotation} 

Ok - so maybe I'm being a little harsh on them. After all it's a great segue.   

\section{Emergent Quantum Mechanics}
Everything, according to this thesis, is emergent, so then must be quantum mechanics. There is even an honest to goodness entire (ok small) research community publishing papers like \cite{tHooft2007},\cite{Grossing2012},\cite{acostaEMERGENTQUANTUMMECHANICS2012},\cite{Walleczek2019}, \cite{Durey2018}, \cite{Andersen2016} etc. 

These emergent quantum theories all say (including mine) that there is some underlying process or commonly a field from which quantum effects emerge.

\subsection{Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs}
One of the most inspiring discoveries in theories of quantum mechanics has been the development of Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs, which is tech speak for little drops of silicon oil that 'self float' above a vibrating little bathtub (watch the videos if you don't believe me). Couder and Fort \cite{eddiInformationStoredFaraday2011} are the acknowledged pioneers of this macroscopic quantum emulation in a petri dish business. (Although I remember being at Dinty's coffee in 1986 and vibrating styro coffee cups, watching the little balls of coffee running around on top of the coffee and thinking - 'thats a great model for particle physics'.) Here are a couple of fun movies to watch - \cite{americanphysicalsocietyFaradayInstabilityFloating2014}, \cite{veritasiumThisWhatQuantum2016} 
 
This research has been expanded on and understood better by Bush and team.\cite{Bush2015a}.

One thing that emergent quantum mechanics has given us is great images.

\subsection{The de Broglie Bohm Model}
Perhaps the most famous theory of quanutm mechanics that comes to mind when one thinks about emergence, is the de Broglie - Bohm theory. From my point of view, de Broglie's theory is more in line with emergent QM, while Bohm showed the world that quantum mechanics can be built with particle positions and waves. 

As J.S. Bell put it:

deliberate theorecital choice quote here...


\subsection{Other models}
Of course no one really thinks that quantum mechanics is powered by $10^{-19}m$ drops running around on some 2D oil bath. Although certain people have nonetheless tried to argue on that basis. Shame on them (not the reporter - the scientists, lol).\cite{wolchoverFamousExperimentDooms2018}

So typically, and with a generous oversimplification by me, one posits a scalar field which is quite classical (remember, we are building quantum mechanics here, so it would be a little circular to  start with a quantum scalar field). Adler\cite{adlerQuantumTheoryEmergent2004} is a pioneer, and Grössing is a person I admired for his attitude, leadership and organizational skills (great EmQM conferences in the mid 2010s)\cite{Grossing2012}. 

de la Peña and Cetto, being non typical, have worked on a theory of emergent quantum mechanics from electromagnetism - and it's pretty nice, too.\cite{DelaPena2015}.

\begin{quotation}
	The main purpose of this book is to show that such alternative exists, and that it is tightly linked to the stochastic zero-point radiation field. This is a fluctuating field, solution of the classical Maxwell equations, yet by having a nonzero mean energy at zero temperature it is foreign to classical physics. The fundamental hypothesis of the theory here developed is that any material system is an open system permanently shaken by this field; the ensuing interaction turns out to be ultimately responsible for quantization. In other words, rather than being an intrinsic property of matter and the (photonic) radiation field, quantization emerges from a deeper stochastic process.
\end{quotation}

Me, being bat crap crazy, have worked on a theory of emergent quantum mechanics from General Relativity - and it's pretty weird, too.\cite{Andersen2016}.
