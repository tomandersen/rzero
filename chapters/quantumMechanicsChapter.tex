\section{Quantum Mechanics}
Since everything, according to my title, is emergent. So is quantum mechanics. There is even an honest to goodness entire (ok tiny) research community publishing papers like \cite{tHooft2007},\cite{Grossing2012},\cite{acostaEMERGENTQUANTUMMECHANICS2012},\cite{Walleczek2019}, \cite{Durey2018}, etc. 

These emergent quantum theories all say (including mine) that there is some underlying process or commonly a field from which quantum effects emerge. The nice
